Words fall out my mouth
They drift to the ground
And they don't make a sound
I'll try to assemble them back
To the place in my head
But I fear that I lack
The proper speak that I need
To narrate the scene
To tell you these things
The proper place for my thoughts
I know that I'm not and you know that I'm not
So clear and transparent
Well I'll try but I can't promise it
So dark but delicate
Well I'm rough around the edges and
You can try to smooth me down
But I'm not, no, I'm not
And you can try to smooth me down
But I'm not ready to forget
You can try to smooth me down
You can try to smooth me down
But I'm not ready to forget
Take back all that I've said
I've said it before and I'll say it again
It's not like me to pretend
But the best part of me is the worst I can give
But you make me so terrified
I tried to reply but I'm shaking inside
You gave me a tongue just to tie
I'll swallow my pride if you swear nor to lie
Hard to read and hard to speak to
But don't take my word
Cause I'm honestly so bored of being
Misunderstood, I'm not
So clear and transparent
Well I'll try but I can't promise it
So dark but delicate
Well I'm rough around the edges and
You can try smooth me down
But I'm not, no, I'm not
And you can try to smooth me down
But I'm not ready to forget
