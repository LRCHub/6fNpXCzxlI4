I am the doctor
With the condition
I am the patient
And the physician
I give myself the scalpel
And make the first incision
I look inside the cut
And make the last decision

We've got to cut it out

I'm taking off my pants
I'm putting on my gloves
I'm gonna heal myself
Cos I'm the one I love

I'll take a shot in the ass
I'll take a shot in the arm
I'll take a shot in the back
I'll take a shot in the heart

Hold on ...
It's ok ...
If we can keep the pace
Then we'll raise the stakes
